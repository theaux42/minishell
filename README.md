# Minishell

ðŸ’» **Minishell** is a small version of the Bash shell, written in C. It replicates essential Bash features, enabling users to run commands, manage processes, and interact with their system through a custom command-line interface.

---

## Features

- Execute system commands (e.g. `ls`, `echo`, `cat`)
- Handle command arguments and simple quoting
- Built-in commands: `cd`, `exit`, `env`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`
- Support for pipes (`|`) and redirections (`<`, `>`)
- Environment variable management
- Error handling and user-friendly prompts

---

## How It Works

Minishell reads input from the user, parses the command, and executes it either as a built-in or by spawning a new process. It mimics many fundamental behaviors of Bash, allowing for basic shell scripting and interactive use.
